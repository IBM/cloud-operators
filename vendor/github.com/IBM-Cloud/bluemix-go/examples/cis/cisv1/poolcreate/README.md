# Pool Create/Get example

This example shows how to create and get a pool. CIS resource instance must be created first via UI or using the `resource/service-instance` example to create an `internet-svcs` instance. 64 digit CRN should be supplied as cis_id variable for zone create/delete. Environment variable IC_API_KEY must be set with API key. 

Paired with Get/Delete example. The Pool created in this example can be used as input to the DNS/Monitor/GLB examples. The pool_id can be retrived from the id field in the last line of the command output.
