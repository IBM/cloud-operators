# This is an example configuration to enable whitewater-detect-secrets in the pre-commit hook.
# Add this file to the root folder of your repository.
#
# Read pre-commit hook framework https://pre-commit.com/ for more details about the structure of config yaml file and how git pre-commit would invoke each hook.

  hooks:
    -   id: detect-secrets # pragma: whitelist secret
        # Add options for detect-secrets-hook binary. You can run `detect-secrets-hook --help` to list out all possible options.
        # You may also run `pre-commit run detect-secrets` to preview the scan result.
        #
        # The `--no-keyword-scan` field can be removed if you are using 0.10.3-ibm.1. It was added prior to 0.10.3-ibm.1 to reduce false positives generated from old keyword scanner.
        # After 0.10.3-ibm.1, keyword scanner is disabled by default.
